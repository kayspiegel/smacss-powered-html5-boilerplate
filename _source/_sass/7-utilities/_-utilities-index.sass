// Utility rules are little helpers you need for your project. Like for centering certain
// text elements, clearing floats, the visibility of elements, global media queries etc.
// All utility classes start with ‘u-’.
//
// You should add most of your media queries next to the corresponding tags and selsctors
// inside the corresponding sass file. But in some more ‘complex’ cases media queries are
// needed to describe how an element, module or layout looks on smaller or bigger screens.
// Those helper media queries can be added here.
