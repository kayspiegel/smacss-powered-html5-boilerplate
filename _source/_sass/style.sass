// This Sass Set is based on the SMACSS (https://smacss.com) methodology.
//
// These Sass files and folders contain a basic setting for you to build some new sites
// for the web. They include most of the core styles from the current HTML5Boilerplate. I
// separated most of the CSS into their belonging folders and files following the SMACSS
// logic.
//
// Use this Sass set to create your site’s and project’s styles, change it as much as you
// like or destroy and rebuild it. It’s your fingers on the keyboard :-)
